# mario-matching

This project is based (heavily) on the the matching mini game from Super Mario Bros 3.

Cards are randomly placed each round. Find pairs to obtain matches and clear rounds. A 'cheat' code is built into the title, click it for extra tries.

This game was built using native web technologies - vanilla javascript, html and CSS.

Enjoy.
